BUILD, DEBUG & INSTALL US-GOV and US-WALLET
    make clean

    build:
    make release   or   make

    binaries generated:
        government unit:
            gov/libusgov.so       - shared library, kernel with core algorithms.
            govx/us-gov           - thin front-end, command-line based.

        wallet unit:
            wallet/libuswallet.so - shared library, keys housekeeping algorithms.
            walletx/us-wallet     - thin front-end, command-line based.

    run without installing:
        bin/us-gov
        bin/us-wallet
        these 'binaries' are shell script wrappers

    debug with gdb
        1 edit the wrapper launchers (see just above) 
        2 there are two lines there, one of them is commented out.
        3 swap these comment marks. (alternamte between normal and debug modes)
        4 run the program normally, gdb will take control of it.
        
    install
        type
        make install

        the prefix is /usr/local

CREATE A GENESIS BLOCK
    genesis directory is not meant to exist in node's git
    
    1-build the binary
    cd genesis
    make clean
    make
    
    2-find by yourself what is going to be the WAN Ip address of this node.
    3.execute
    ./genesis <IP>

CONTROL DAEMONS
    /etc/init.d/us-gov start|stop
    /etc/init.d/us-wallet start|stop

LISTENING PORTS
    us-gov listens on port 16672
    us-wallet listens on port 16673

WHERE IS THE NODE PRIVATE KEY?
    ~/.us/gov/k

RUN AN INTROSPECTIVE SHELL INTO GOV PROCESS
    only if you can tell the private-key of the node 

    a) gov daemon is reachable at localhost
        1 just execute 
          us-gov 
    b) otherwise, is reachable at a remote host
        1 write the node key at ~/.us/gov/k        
        2 execute 
          us-gov -host <ipaddress>

BUILD THE JAVA SDK
    cd sdk/java
    ./make
    will jenerate the jar:
    us-wallet-sdk.jar

BUILD & INSTALL ANDROID US-CASH APP
    - note: USE JDK-8 - 9 and 10 wont work with android sdk
    apt install openjdk-8-jdk or oracle

    cd cash/android
    JAVA_HOME=<your jdk8> ./make

    find the generated apk at:
    ./app/build/outputs/apk/release/us.cash-v1-release.apk
    
    INSTALL
    execute:
    bin/install_us-cash-android-app
