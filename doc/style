Coding style
============

comments are minimal, documentation is elsewhere.

Vertical space is optimized at the expense of horizontal space.
Comments are 1 line using // appended at the end of the first line they apply to.

Relevant types are stored in their own file. Their names match.

in the scope of a cpp file the identifier c represents the type name
in the scope of a type c, the subtype c::b represents the main base class

function prototypes occupy only one line, regardless of its length.

scope opening curly braces {
<4 space indent>body
} // closing

Upper case are only used for MACROS, to yell, because macros don't respect c++ scope rules.
Lower case is used elsewhere, identifiers, constants, etc.

Struct is preferred rather than class.

protected and private sections are innofensive but are rather not written.

source code organization is as flat as possible, with all components listed under the root directory
avoiding fitting them into a tree-based classification. (relations form different graphs
depending on classification criteria, rather than a single tree).
