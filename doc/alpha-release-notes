Engineering

alpha release planned for end of this month.

versioning: alpha means internal user testing, beta means user testing in a controlled environment, 1 means public release

The release likely will experience delays if unexpected problems arise in 
the following (now unmaintained) areas: Raspberry PI Operating System, API front-end

The backend area is a bit off-schedule as well:
areas in in-progress status: neuralyzer (hard disk optimization)
                                     security in communications between mobile and node
	                             protocol versioning


alpha release include features:
network node implementation delivered as an ISO image which can be burned into a memory SD card.
the project has two major units: governance and wallet.
governance
    blockchain protocol implementation for which nodes are coordinated themselves.

wallet
    Android 6.0 app featuring a lean (minimum) interface for transfering cash each other via NFC(~Contact less) or QR Code.
    REST API allowing accessing wallet functions programaticaly.
    linux command 'us-wallet' to operate the wallet in two modes:
       local: your wallet is stored in a file in your computer
       rpc: your wallet resides in a remote server
    wallet-daemon: required for allowing you have a wallet client remotely, e.g. the android app.

    wallet functions: 
		* key management.
		* cash transfer.

Both ISO image and Androud-app download links are available accessing the node via its IP Address with a browser.
